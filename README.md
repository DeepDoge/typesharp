# breeze-script

An exprimental, hobby, fun, scripting or programming language idk, that has a really interesting typing system and has no GC also with a stack first approach.<br/>
Aims to be readable by anyone, tries to combine `what typescript can be` and `some of rust but with better syntax by using already exiting concepts that does the same job instead of making up things`.<br/>

Can be compiled to any language like `C`, `C#`, idk anything.<br/>
At first I'm gonna make it compile to `C#` but without GC and reference types.<br/>
Later in the future maybe i can make it compile to `WASM` or `ASM` directly.<br/>
Tho compiling to `C` or `C#` is probably better since their compiling to `WASM` and `ASM` always gets improved.

It's really, really and really early in the development... There is nothing yet just stuff in my head that idk if works or not.
